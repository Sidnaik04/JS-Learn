In javascript don't include any events within html tags as it reduces scalability. e.g: <h1 onclick="alert("hello")>Hello</h1>

This is also not good practice
document.getElementById('owl').onclick=function(){
        alert("Owl")
}

This is best
document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener('click',function(){
        alert('Owl clicked')
})

Things to study
types of events, timestamp, preventDefault
target, toElement, srcElement, currentTarget,
clientX, clientY, screenX, screenY
altkey, ctrlkey, shiftkey, keyCode

//Event stopPropagation: depends on use cases
Bubble events: In this "clicked inside ul" will be at bottom and "clicked on owl" will be at top. Bottom to Top 
capturing events: In this "clicked inside ul" will be at top and "clicked on owl" will be at bottom. Top to Bottom 
stopPropagation: Eliminate both bubble and capturing events. 


setTimeout, clearTimeout
